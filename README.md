#### Description: 
Unscramble is a game where a random word from a set is chosen and scrambled fro the player to unscramble.
It was made using swift, for iOS devices. 
I use a csv file as a database for words. There are 4 sets of words: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. These range from words with 4-7 letters that are commonly used in our day to day lives.

USAGE:

When opening the game you will be greeted with the Welcome View.

The highest score at the bottom, is your all time highest score. This will persist even if the game is quit.

To start the game, simply click on any of the difficulty buttons and a game with that difficulty will begin.

After the game has begun, You will have five lives indicated by the hearts at the top of the screen.

Your highest score and current game score will appear above that. Along with a Home button, which takes you back to the Welcome View.

Below these, you will see your Current Word, which is scrambled and a Keyboard with a Delete Button and a Submit Button. Along with a Skip button, which allows you to skip the current word without losing a life, however gaining no points.

Once you start typing, your current guess will pop up! This will be shown with a smaller font than the scrambled word, and in between the scrambled word and the Skip Button.

You will notice that the game does not allow you to submit a word that has less characters than that of the Current Word, and will not allow you to type more characters than that as well. In order to prevent accidental submits and extra character mistakes.

When you run out of lives, this is what you will see:

Your current game score will be at the top. A Game Over title in the center, with a home button which takes you to the Welcome View; and a Try Again button which will simply reset the game and start you fresh off with the same difficulty you had previously selected.
You will also see your highest score at the bottom.

Have fun!
