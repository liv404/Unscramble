#### Description: 
Unscramble is a game where a random word from a set is chosen and scrambled fro the player to unscramble.
It was made using swift, for iOS devices. 
I use a csv file as a database for words. There are 4 sets of words: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. These range from words with 4-7 letters that are commonly used in our day to day lives.
